                At this point I should know how effective I can be.  A good portion of the learning curve has been overcome by now.  I should be able to discuss the platform in depth.  I should be able to jump in a add code effectively now.  We should have identified the skillset we need and recruit as such.  At this time, we may have a few candidates ready for interviewing.  New hires should be integrated and effective as soon as possible.  Any weaknesses early on need to be evaluated.  We need to get rid of weak links quickly.  A plan for infrastructure should be identified by now.  Time to reduce cost and increase revenue here.
